> Open Source Software Finder

---

## Why

> Contributing to open source softwares makes you a better developer.

By contributing to different open source softwares, you get to engage with
various best practices, frameworks, libraries, source codes, test codes, etc...

Which in return will make you understand more about software development in
general and become a better developer.

However, when you are interested in contributing to various open source
softwares, it is not easy to find the right issues that are open to contribution
when you have the time.

This project was started to solve this issue.

## How

You can start using this project by following this steps

1. Star some projects you like (preferably thost that you use on a daily basis)
2. [Get a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with
   `read:user` permission
3. Visit https://www.ossfinder.com
4. Login with your previously made `token`
5. Watch some issue labels that you are interested on your starred repository.
   (ex: `good first issue` or `help wanted`)

## What

OSS Finder seeks to help you find issues on your starred repositories with the
labels that you are watching and therefore helping you to contribute to them
when you are interested.
